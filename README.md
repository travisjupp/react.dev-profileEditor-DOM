# react.dev-profileEditor-DOM

Created with CodeSandbox

This form switches between two modes: in the editing mode, you see the inputs, and in the viewing mode, you only see the result. The button label changes between “Edit” and “Save” depending on the mode you’re in. When you change the inputs, the welcome message at the bottom updates in real time.

Your task is to reimplement it in React (see solution: https://github.com/travisjupp/react.dev-profileEditor-React).
